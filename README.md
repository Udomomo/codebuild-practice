# codebuild-practice
Practice to 
- build docker image on codebuild pipeline
- deploy it to ECR
- And use it as an execution environment for other codebuild pipeline

## Dockerfile
- `Dockerfile` : To build codebuild custom image, based on standard image
- `sample.Dockerfile`: To test using build cache for multi stage build
